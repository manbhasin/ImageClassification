# Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are most commonly used to analyze visual imagery and are frequently working behind the scenes in image classification.

# Image Classification 
Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “cat”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a cat”).
